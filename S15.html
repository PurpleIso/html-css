        <h1>Robert Urie's S15</h1>
        <P>
            In 1920, the final of Robert Urie's 4-6-0 standard locomotives would be introduced. They had 5ft 7inch driving wheels, and 2 21x28inch cylinders. Urie made the engines 4-6-0s, rather than the more popular 0-8-0 or 2-8-0 wheel configurations for heavy freight engines. This was to allow them to reach greater speeds, so they had the upper hand over the Great Western on fast freight services.
            Between 1920 and 1936, a total of 45 would be built. After some slight modification, the locomotives would become extremely successful, being most associated with the night trains out of Southampton Harbour, and various freight services around London.
            All 45 lasted into British Rail ownership. They would not start being withdrawn until 1962, with the last being retired in 1966, hauling a farewell railtour to Feltham.
            A very impressive 7 of these 45 locomotives remain, 2 LSWR built examples and 5 SR built examples. The 2 LSWR engines are E499, which is under restoration, and E506, which is currently operational. both are located at the Mid-Hants railway. Another SR built example can be found there, E828, which is also undergoing restoration.
            3 of the SR locomotives can be found on the North Yorkshire Moors railway, number E825, which is operational, E830, which is awaiting restoration, and 841, which is being used as a temporary parts donor. The Last example of the class built, SR 847, can be found on the Bluebell railway, where it is on display in their museum.
