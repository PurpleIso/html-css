            <h1>Southern Railway Priciple Locomotives</h1>
            <p>In 1923 the railway grouping act of the United Kingdom would go into effect. This made it so most major railways would be combined into 4 Bigger railways, known as the Big Four. The Southern railway was one of these, being made up out of the former London, Brighton and South Coast railway, London & Southwestern railway & the South Eastern and Chatham Railway.</p>
            <p>The railway appointed Richard Maunsell to become the Chief mechanical engineer. It was his decision to to have 4 standard designs to help modernize the railway. Instead of designing all new engines, he used 4 slightly older but still modern designs. These where his own N class design of 1917, aswell as 3 Designs from the London & Southwestern railway; Robert Urie's H15 of 1914, the N15 of 1918 and the S15 of 1920.</p>
            <p>This page is about these 4 locomotive types.</p>
