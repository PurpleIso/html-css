    <h1>Robert Urie's H15</h1>
    <p>In 1914, the London & Southwestern railway's chief mechanical engineer, Robert Urie, saw to it that 3 new standard designs would enter service to replace the aging fleet of the LSWR.
    The first of these was the H15, which was designed to do both freight and passenger workings. The first 11 would be completed in 1914 (one being a rebuild of the earlier E14 class of 1905), with more being planned. However, with the outbreak of world war 1, the British government banned railways from building Passenger oriented locomotives, which the H15, with its 6ft driving wheels, fell under.
    Construction would not restart of the H15 until 1924, by which point the Southern railway had formed. The SR built another 15 locomotives of this type, the last being completed in 1925.
    The engines preformed exceptionally. With their at the time relatively large duo of 21x26 Inch cylinders, and the 6ft driving wheels, paired with the 4-6-0 wheel configuration, and the incredibly freesteaming boilers made them one of the best driving engines of its time.
    Noteably, the later onces built in 1924 had improved largers cabs, which reportedly made it so crews below the height of roughly 1,80M had to stand on a makeshift stool to be able to properly operate the engines.
    All of the H15 would survive into British Rail ownership in 1948. The engines started being withdrawn in 1955, with the last of them lasting until 1961. None have remained in Preservation.
